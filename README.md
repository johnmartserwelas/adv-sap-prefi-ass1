## Assignment in Advanced Systems Integration & Architecture
1. Define Service Oriented Architecture(SOA).
-SOA modularizes software into standardized, flexible services, promoting reusability. Real-time communication ensures interoperability, and loose coupling facilitates sophisticated business process composition. With a focus on scalability and reuse, SOA is valuable for managing complex systems in dynamic computing environments.

2. List and discuss the characteristics of SOA.
-Services encourage modularity, and flexible maintenance is made possible by loose coupling. Reusability reduces development efforts while interoperability guarantees seamless service interaction. Well-defined interfaces are made possible by abstraction, and complex business processes are made possible by service composition. Flexibility is increased by service discoverability, and both vertical and horizontal scaling are supported by scalability. Standardization guarantees interactions that are uniform, and governance manages service lifecycles to guarantee compliance and boost dependability.

3. Define Microservices.
-It describes an architectural approach that is modular in nature and breaks down large, complicated software systems into smaller, self-contained services. This allows for seamless integration, scalability, and flexibility while creating and managing sophisticated applications.

4. List and discuss the benefits of using Microservices.
-Microservices architecture offers several benefits, including improved productivity, better resiliency, increased scalability, support for continuous delivery and continuous integration, and the ability to optimize business functionality.

5. List and discuss the similarities and differences of SOA and Microservices.
-Microservices and Service-Oriented ArchitecturesÂ prioritize scalability, interoperability, and loose coupling. But microservices are more compact, more autonomous, support a wider range of technologies, and prioritize self-contained development and implementation. They frequently leverage dynamic service discovery, have shorter lifecycles, and decentralized data management. SOA services, on the other hand, could be larger, share more components, and have a more uniform technological stack. They could have longer lifecycles, a consolidated data layer, more static service discovery techniques, and more coordination requirements. Whereas SOA has historical links to conventional enterprise level designs, microservices are linked to contemporary, agile development cultures.
